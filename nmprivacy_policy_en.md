# Drudge's Diary Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: January 15, 2025**

Drudge's Diary (the “App”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the App. Please read it carefully before using the App.

## 1. Information Collection

### 1.1 Information We Handle

**Important: The App is designed to store your data locally on your device. We do not proactively collect, store, or upload your personal data to our servers.**

The App may store the following information locally on your device:
- **Task data**: task content, completion status, timestamps, etc.
- **Review data**: your reflections/reviews for tasks and timestamps
- **Pet data**: virtual pet status, attributes, decorations, etc.
- **Achievement data**: unlocked achievements
- **Reminder settings**: your reminder preferences
- **Username**: the name you set for local display

### 1.2 Information We Do Not Collect

We do not collect:
- Government ID numbers, phone numbers, or similar identity information
- Precise location information
- Your contacts, SMS, call logs, photos, or videos
- Any information that can directly identify you, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the App

### 1.3 Third-Party Services

The App may rely on system services and third-party platforms:
- **System notifications**: used to deliver reminders; notification content is delivered via the operating system
- **App stores**: when you download the App, the app store may collect certain information under its own policies

## 2. How Information Is Used

We use locally stored information only to:
- Provide and improve App features on your device
- Display your tasks, reviews, pet, and statistics within the App
- Generate summaries, statistics, and reports locally (unless you explicitly use online AI features)

## 3. Data Storage and Security

### 3.1 Storage Location

- Data is stored locally on your device.
- We do not provide cloud backup by default.

### 3.2 Security

We take reasonable measures in the App’s design to reduce data exposure risks. However, you are responsible for device-level security (e.g., device passcode, OS security updates).

### 3.3 Export / Backup

You can export your data as a Markdown file and store it locally. You decide how to back up or share the exported file.

## 4. Your Rights

Because data is stored locally, you can manage it directly in the App (e.g., edit, delete). Uninstalling the App will typically remove local data, subject to your device’s behavior and backups.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will provide notice in the App when appropriate. Continued use indicates acceptance of the updated policy.

## 6. Contact

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the support channel provided within the App.
